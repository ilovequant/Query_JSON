# Query_JSON
This work implements the basic mechanism of storing and querying documents in JSON format. 

There are three basic operations: add, get and delete

add, store the given document;
get, find all documents which have the same properties and corresponding values as the given document;
delete, remove all documents with the same properties and values as the given document
